# Text to Image generation using Autogon AI

>This app is showcasing the Autogon AI power and this can be integrated into any application for gamification or for users to generate their AI image based on a specific prompt. 

This app was built using react [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) and little vanilla css.

To run this app locally, you need to have an (Autogon)[https://autogon.ai/] account, so as to be able to get your API key. If you don't have an existing account, signup, and log in to your dashboard, click your profile image, then click on settings, you'd find the tab for API, generate your API key and come back to your code for usage.

At the root level of your app (that is, the same location where your `vite.config.js` is located), create a `.env` file and put your API key there for safety.

>the `sample.env` file is there to guide you on what is needed
